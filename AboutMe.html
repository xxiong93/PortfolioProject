        I grew up in Sheboygan, WI and moved to Milwaukee for college. This is where I also met my girlfriend. 
        I enjoy playing video games and love spending time outdoors, especially fishing.
        A few of my favorite foods are Pho, homemade spaghetti carbonara, and papaya salad.
        Our puppy's name is Loki.
